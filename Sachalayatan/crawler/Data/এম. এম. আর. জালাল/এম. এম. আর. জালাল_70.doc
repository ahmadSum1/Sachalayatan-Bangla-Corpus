Bangladesh is now governed by Ph.D's .Military Officer's  and Barrister's.
Dr. M.Yunus Dr. Kamal.Dr. Oli Ahmed, Dr. Fakruddin and  now another Dr.Quraishi.Barister Moinul.......and all military officers (No need to put their names because they are many). These elites are out of touch of common people! No country or nation could make success and progress for the country and common people with this scholars! Only common and mediocre people can do the maximum betterment for the country and its inhabitants - at least history tells us that! Democracy is the only means to change the fate of the commoners and the country while it is executed as great Lincoln defines Democracy as "Of the people By the People and For the People!" If any one thinks Ph.D holders and scholars can make the change of the fate of a nation then they are living in  fools paradise!!  Amaader durbhaggo.
