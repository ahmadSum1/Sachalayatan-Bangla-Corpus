Dear All,
I write to you regarding my father's deportatioon status. Unfortunately, there is no good news to report. The federal judge ruled to lift the TRO on the deportation based on his lack of jurisdiction. The deportation order stands and we have been given 24 hours - my father will be sent back as soon as tomorrow evening Thursday).
With all the support from US Congress members and Canadian parliament members, along with Amnesty International and various NGO's, Homeland Security has chosen to continue the process of deportation and return my father to Bangladesh. It is my opinion that it is quite apparent there are bigger interests at hand in regards to international/foreign policy between the US and Bangladesh and amidst all of this, my father is just a pawn in a much larger political game.
As you can understand, the next few days are going to be difficult and traumatic for both myself and my famly. My mother has decided to travel to Bangladesh with my father. There is a possibility that my sister and I will never see our parents again.
At this time we will continue to fight in bangladesh - they HAVE to give him a retrial, a fair trial.
I dont know how to Thank you for all of support and understanding on this personal matter.
Sincerely,
Rouben
