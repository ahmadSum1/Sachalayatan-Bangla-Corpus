বিচার সম্ভব, চাই সরকারের সদিচ্ছা



(লেখাটি বিডিনিউজ টুয়েন্টিফোর ডটকমে প্রকাশিত, এটা আনএডিটেড ভার্সন)
হঠাৎ করেই সারাদেশ উত্তাল করে দিলেন আলী আহসান মুজাহিদ। জামায়াতে ইসলামীর সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল ১৯৭১ সালে তার দলের ভূমিকা নিয়ে সাংবাদিকদের চ্যালেঞ্জ জানিয়েছেন। বলেছেন, “আপনারাই খুঁজে বের করুন, মূল্যায়ন করুন।” পাশাপাশি সবচেয়ে বেশি ঝড় তুলেছে তার আরো কিছু কথা- “বাংলাদেশে কোনো যুদ্ধাপরাধী নেই। যারা ছিল তাদের ক্ষমা করে দেওয়া হয়েছে।” তাকে ডাহা মিথ্যেবাদী বলার চেয়ে কথাগুলো যৌক্তিকভাবে খন্ডানোর একটা প্রয়াস অবশ্যই নেওয়া যায়। তবে তার চেয়ে জরুরী হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে সর্বসাধারণের একটি প্রশ্নের জবাব- যুদ্ধাপরাধী বা মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সময় পাকিস্তান সেনাবাহিনীর যারা দালালী করেছে, যারা বাঙালী মেরেছে, বুদ্ধিজীবিদের নৃশংসভাবে হত্যা করেছে, ধর্ষন-লুটপাটে যারা জড়িত, তাদের বিচার সম্ভব কিনা। উত্তর হচ্ছে অবশ্যই সম্ভব। কীভাবে সম্ভব এ নিয়েই আমাদের একটি পর্যালোচনা। 
তার আগে কিছু বিষয় পরিষ্কার করে নেওয়া যায়। এখনও অনেকেই একটি ভুল ধারণা নিয়ে বিতর্ক তোলেন ও করেন। বলা হয়ে থাকে বঙ্গবন্ধু শেখ মুজিবর রহমান যুদ্ধাপরাধী দালাল ও রাজাকারদের ক্ষমা করে দিয়েছেন। কথাটা পুরো সত্যি নয়। ১৯৭৩ সালের ৩০ নভেম্বর থেকে কার্যকর সাধারণ মা ঘোষনার আওতায় প্রান্তিক পর্যায়ের দালাল ও রাজাকারদের ক্ষমা করা হয়েছে। হত্যা, লুটপাট, ধর্ষন এবং স্বাধীনতা বিরোধী ষড়যন্ত্রের সঙ্গে সরাসরি সম্পর্কিত এবং নেতৃস্থানীয় কোনো দালাল ও ঘাতককে এই ক্ষমা ঘোষণার আওতায় নেওয়া হয়নি। অধ্যাপক গোলাম আযম থেকে শুরু করে নুরুল আমিন, হামিদুল হক চৌধুরী, খান এ সবুর, মাহমুদ আলী, খাজা খয়েরুদ্দিন, রাজা ত্রিদিব রায়ের মতো নেতৃস্থানীয় স্বাধীনতাবিরোধীদের স্থাবর-অস্থাবর সম্পত্তি ক্রোক করে তাদের ফেরার ঘোষণা করা হয় (১০ ফেব্র“য়ারি, ১৯৭২, দৈনিক বাংলা)। ক্ষমার আওতায় পড়েননি রাজাকার ও আলবদর বাহিনীর কোনো নেতা। তালিকা দেখলে দেখা যাবে ঠিক কারা এসব নেতৃত্বে ছিলেন। 
এবার আসা যাক দালালদের বিচারের প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে। ১৯৭১ সালের ৩ ডিসেম্বর ভারতে প্রবাসী বাংলাদেশ সরকারের মন্ত্রীসভার একটি বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হয়। সেখানে প্রথম ‘ট্রায়াল অব কোলাবরেটরস’ বা দালালদের বিচারের ধরণ নিয়ে প্রথম আলোচনা হয়। পরবর্তী বৈঠক বসে ১৩ ডিসেম্বর। দুটো বৈঠকের সারবেত্তা নিয়ে ১৫ ডিসেম্বর একটি গোপন নথি প্রকাশিত হয় এবং এর অনুলিপি প্রতিটি সচিবকে পাঠানো হয়। (লিংক-১) বৈঠকের সিদ্ধান্ত অনুযায়ী দালালদের বিচার করার জন্য বিচার বিভাগ গঠন করা হবে। সেখানে সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া হয় রেডিও এবং অন্যান্য সংবাদ মাধ্যমে ঘোষণা দিয়ে সব দালালদের গ্রেপ্তার করা হবে এবং তাদের বিচার করা হবে। এখন কাদের দালাল বলা হবে এবং ঠিক কী ধরণের অপরাধ দেশদ্রোহী এবং দালালী বলে চিহ্নিত করা হবে তা নিয়ে বিস্তারিত আলোচনা পরবর্তী বৈঠকে করা হবে বলে নির্ধারিত হয়। কিন্তু পরদিনই বাংলাদেশ স্বাধীন হয়ে যায়।
১৯৭২ সালের ১ জানুয়ারী অস্থায়ী রাষ্ট্রপতি সৈয়দ নজরুল ইসলাম তার মন্ত্রী পরিষদ নিয়ে এক বৈঠকে গনহত্যা তদন্ত কমিশন গঠনের সিদ্ধান্ত নেন। হাইকোর্টে কর্মরত কিংবা অবসরপ্রাপ্ত কোনো বিচারপতি বা সমপর্যায়ের কোনো মাননীত ব্যক্তির নেতৃত্বে কমিশন পাকবাহিনী ও তাদের দালালদের হাতে ক্ষতিগ্রস্থদের মৌখিক ও লিখিত সাক্ষাতকার নিয়ে তদন্ত রিপোর্ট প্রকাশ করবেন বলে ঘোষণা দেওয়া হয়।
২৪ জানুয়ারি ‘বাংলাদেশ দালাল আইন ১৯৭২’ নামে (লিংক-২) একটি অধ্যাদেশ জারি হয়। শেখ মুজিবর রহমান সারিত সেই অধ্যাদেশে যুদ্ধপরাধী এবং দালালের সংজ্ঞা দেওয়া হয়েছে এভাবে Ñ)কোনো ব্যক্তি যদি একক বা দলগতভাবে বা কোনো সংস্থার হয়ে প্রত্য বা পরোভাবে পাকিস্তান সেনাবাহিনীর গনহত্যা, লুটপাট, ধর্ষনে সহযোগিতা করে থাকে এবং স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশ বিরোধী কর্মকান্ডে এবং বাংলাদেশের বিপক্ষে যুদ্ধে জড়িত থাকে। কমপক্ষে ২ মাস থেকে সর্বোচ্চ মৃত্যুদন্ডের শাস্তির বিধান রাখা হয়েছিল এই আইনে। অনেক ফাঁকফোকড় ছিল এ আইনে, যার ৭ম ধারায় থানার ভারপ্রাপ্ত কর্মকর্তাকে সর্বময় কর্তৃত্ব দেওয়া হয়েছিল। ওসি যদি কারো বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ না আনেন তাহলে সেটা গ্রহন করা হবে না, অন্য কোনো আদালতে তার বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ করা যাবে না- এমন অনেক গলদে ভর্তি ছিল আইনটি। 
সময়টায় ১১ হাজারেরও বেশি দালাল ও রাজাকার তাদের গ্রেপ্তার করার জন্য আবেদন জানায়, যাতে এই আইনের  ফাক গলে বেরিয়ে যেতে পারে। ২৪ মার্চ নাগাদ ৭৩টি বিশেষ আদালত গঠন করা হয় দালালদের বিচারে। এপ্রিল থেকে শুরু হয় বিচার। সাধারণ মা ঘোষণার আগে ১৯৭৩ সালের ৩১ অক্টোবর পর্যন্ত ৩৭ হাজার ৪৭১জন অভিযুক্তের মধ্যে নিষ্পত্তি হয়েছিল ২ হাজার ৮৪৮ জনের মামলা। এদের মধ্যে বিভিন্ন মেয়াদে দন্ডাদেশ পেয়েছে ৭৫২ জন যার মধ্যে মৃত্যুদন্ডে দন্ডিত হয় ১ জন এবং বেকসুর খালাস পায় ২ হাজার ৯৬ জন। এই দালাল আইনটি পরে বাতিল হয়ে যায়।
তবে ১৯৭৩ সালের ২০ জুলাই আন্তর্জাতিক আইনে যুদ্ধপরাধীদের সাজা দেওয়ার জন্য নতুন একটি আইন পাস হয়। ‘অ্যাক্ট নং-১৯, ১৯৭৩’ (লিংক-৩) নামের এই আইনে গনহত্যা, মানবতার বিরুদ্ধে অপরাধ, যুদ্ধাপরাধে অপরাধীদের গ্রেপ্তার, বিচার এবং সাজা দেওয়ার অধিকার রাখা হয়। নব্বই দশকের শুরুতে শহীদ জননী জাহানারা ইমামের নেতৃত্বে ঘাতক-দালাল নির্মূল কমিটি এই আইনটিকেই অবলম্বন করে মাঠে নামে। এই আইনে বাদী হতে পারেন সরকার। এবং সাক্ষ্য হিসেবে ঘটনার সময়কার পেপারকাটিং থেকে শুরু করে ছবি এবং ফুটেজ পর্যন্ত প্রমাণ হিসেবে উত্থাপন করা যাবে। মাত্র দুমাসের মধ্যে বিশেষ এই ট্রাইবুনাল তাদের বিচার শেষ করতে পারবে। অর্থাৎ সরকার যদি বিচার করতে আন্তরিকভাবে আগ্রহী হয়, যুদ্ধাপরাধে অভিযুক্তদের গ্রেপ্তার করে, তারপর তাদের বিরুদ্ধে সাক্ষ্যপ্রমাণ নিয়ে এ দেশের লাখো শহীদের স্বজনরা আগ্রহভরেই হাজির হবেন। তাই দরকার সরকারের স্বদিচ্ছা। আইন আছে, স্বাক্ষী আছে, অপরাধী আছে। বিচার সম্ভব।
