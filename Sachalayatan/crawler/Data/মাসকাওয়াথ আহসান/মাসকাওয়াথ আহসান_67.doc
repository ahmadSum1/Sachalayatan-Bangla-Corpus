Madam Bovary and the secret kite
This time Madam Bovary tried hard to be blindly monogamic and persistent in her holy persuade. Really, it doesn't matter how many times she fell in love at first sight, had a crush at a nexalite, felt
euphoric around handsome university professors, sat through pot-wine romance with her British boss or finally played a hitchhiking game with Arjuna.
Madam Bovary, being the intense person that she is, has had a long list of admirers. And so was her enormously long hobby: kiting through colourful days and nights.
I never question her romantic ardours and nose-top sinking myths. She is always blue without a man: a man she wants to love or be loved by, to admire or be admired by.
When I saw Madam Bovary at the Bonn railway station in a khajura posture with a Casanova by her side, I instantly felt they were made for each other. With glittering eyes and courtship dreams when they suddenly left Yadav Ji's daughter's wedding reception I prayed
heartily for their all-out happiness on earth.
But this Madam Bovary is actually as confused as that Madam Bovary;
constantly taking off and putting on her wedding ring that reminds her of her pundit husband. It's not a theory but although pundits can  attract girls, they can hardly sustain their charms. Perhaps pundits can't flirt or feel comfortable in discos. The Madam Bovarys of this world can only visit Guimet museums with them and share the essence of  the Frankfurt school of thought or at best go biking and swimming.
What this Madam Bovary needed is perhaps an all-in-one like the Arjuna
of Mahabharata. Arjuna, by nature a James Bond of mythical times, can
hit the eye of a fish with his arrow without failing to win the paragon of beauty, Droupadi. James Bond's attraction lies in not holding his trophy for long but distributing it amongst his in-group.
More like Ocean's Eleven co-operative robbery style.
Arjuna shares the glory of Droupadi with his four brothers, Nakul, Sahadev, Vim and Judhisthir. So the Droupadi-Bovary story has a lovable Nakul, cute Sahadev, trustworthy Judhisthir and the unfaithful Arjuna. 
Arjuna is practically a capitalist, so theoretically a womanizer. I often saw Nakul drive her to Amsterdam for grass, Sahadev shed emotional tears in sympathy and give laptop warmth. But it's Vim who could be the best husband to this soft, charming, love-torn Droupadi  Bovary. Judhisthir as all know could only be expected to give fatherly
affection. For Madam Bovary the sole worth-achieving target left was Arjuna.
Let's add allusions and a little complication to the story. There's a
huge debate over Ram Mandir and Babri Mosque catastrophe. Now had
there been an Arjuna Mandir and a Babri Mosque one after the other, chaos would not have stood a chance. The Arjuna of our story is full of Mughal chivalry that desires subjugation of his Bibi behind layered  curtains. Bibi placed on a regal pedestal curtained off from
chilman-style mujra. Madam Droupadi could not take this chauvinistic hegemony, and took upon herself the task of toppling Arjuna's arrogant
chariot: Begum Sahiba should be informed of his mischieves. Life could
not go on all tipsy topsy. Madam Bovary, lying on Nakul's voluntary lap looked at the full moon, mindlessly haunted by the zeal of lycanthropic revenge She called up to consult Lahory Kurratul Bai, who had been recently  elevated to Begum Kurra Baerth by a fishing German lovebird. Kurra Bai was quite familiar with the conservative Muslim Bibi types and their possessiveness of their mujra-seeking husbands. Upon Kurra Bai's
suggestion Madam Bovary invited her British boss Lucifera for a palace conspiracy over pot-wine moonlit dinner.
Droupadi Bovary spent the night  onvincing Lucifera and herself of Arjuna's untold heartless escapades.
"Honey, why are you wasting time. Get in touch with Arjuna's tyrant princess and tell her about his black activities."
Nakul used to be the pigeon-carrier of Arjuna's love letters, secretly maintaining a log book throughout. And yes, Madam Bovary had been flying kites for 32 years. She didn't mind cutting off a few strings at a whim. But one kite she preserved till the last.
"I can show my last kite to the angry princess anytime and bring
Tsunami into Arjuna's island of faith."
Madam Bovary, instead of following the elegant Mahabharata theme, opted for Star Plus-style soap climax. One thing she had not bargained for was the princess' cool demeanor. 
"I let my prince fly from time to time, so that I can keep his soul with me. It may sound old-fashioned but if truth be told, a soul can never be polygamic."
Faced with this unexpectedness, Droupadi recovered her elegance. Soap
endings are really not her style. At once she went back to the intense canvas of Mahabharata. God bless you, Madam.
