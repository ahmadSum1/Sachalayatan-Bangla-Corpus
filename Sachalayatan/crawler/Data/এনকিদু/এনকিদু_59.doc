Just today we have arrived in our home land! But not in happy mood in an angry roaring mood! We went to carry out exercise in qatar but here somethings were happening! We will not accept their unruly illegal occuring over our dreamest dearest motherland! May be tomorrow we will be joining to defend them to save our piece of land! If we bloody die even we dont bother! We have you the mass people! We have your passions your dedications your well wishes! We all want to die their with honour, with pride! Perhaps they got weapons, they got china, they got damn fucken usa, uk oil companies! Do we care? Absolutely not! If they dont listen good words they will see some good fires on their ass definitely! I would love them escaping to see before i die! Please if i die even in incoming maritime war, if my poor body not found in my lovely home sea, then dont be left with crying for me! Just join us to uplift us to resist their aggression! You all of my soulmate our
hope to fight them! And we are there to let you sleep everyday in your home with peace! So pray for our sleepless endurence! For our bloodless victory if possible! If not then dont burry me before our victory!
Thanks a lot to Almighty to give me such grand oppurtunity to die! I hope they will understand us, they will leave us with respect not with fear! If not then may fear gets them with bloody death! Allah hafiz!

Subject: Present situation detoriates!
Yester day again myanmar denied to suspend their all oil gas rig exploration activities! So we are now ready. But why our mass people are not informed? I am not getting at all! Surprisingly we are showing our interest on new elected president, our conventional elections, etc. Why media is keeping silence in every pages?
May be government does not want to get their people panic! Ha ha ha! Who cares if they occupy our land, sea? Never mind! I am preparing my ship for deployment now. But i will be going on board khalid bin walid.
How are you all fine? Allah hafiz.
